# Mobile-data-Analysis


The aim of this project is to optimize battery performance for users in the highest
usage category (user behavior class 5) by identifying device models with high battery
drain relative to screen-on time and app usage time. Based on this, the goal is to
recommend specific strategies to reduce battery consumption by at least 10%, such as
adjusting device settings or optimizing app usage. Additionally, the project will analyze
the correlation between app usage time and user behavior class, identifying factors
such as the number of apps installed and data usage that influence battery
performance.
